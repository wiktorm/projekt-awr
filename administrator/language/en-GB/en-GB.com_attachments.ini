INSTALL_NOTES_2=Once an attachment is uploaded, it is not visible until it is published.  To do this go to the administrative backend and select "Attachments" under the "Components" menu.  This will show a list of attachments and has controls to publish the attachments.  The option to make attachments automatically published after they are uploaded can be changed via the Attachments component manager.
INSTALL_NOTES_3=This extension respects the options in the Media Manager regarding what types of files can be uploaded.  If you can&rsquo;t attach certain file types (such as zip files), go to the "Global Configuration" item under the "Site" menu in the administrative backend.  Click on the "System" tab and look for the "Media Settings" section.  You can add appropriate file extensions or mime types there.
INSTALL_NOTES_4=Please see the help page for further details, including known limitations of this extension.  To get to the help page, select "Attachments" under the "Components" menu in the adminstrative backend.  Click on the help icon on the toolbar to bring up the help page.
