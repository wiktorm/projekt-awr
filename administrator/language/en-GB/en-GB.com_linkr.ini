# FAQ
FAQ_1=How do I use Linkr?
FAQ_1_ANSWER=Linkr is a content plugin. To use it, go to &quot;Administrator &#187; Content &#187; Article Manager&quot; and select any article. If the plugin is properly installed, you should find a &quot;Linkr&quot; button at the bottom of the page.
FAQ_2=Can Linkr create menu links?
FAQ_2_ANSWER=No. Linkr is a tool for adding links to your articles and for improving %s for your site. If you want to create a new menu link, you need to use the Menu Manager.
FAQ_3=I can't find the Linkr button!
FAQ_3_ANSWER=You need to download the plugin from %s and install it. Once you've downloaded it, go to &quot;Administrator &#187; Extensions &#187; Install/Uninstall&quot; and install the plugin. Make sure to activate it in &quot;Administrator &#187; Extensions &#187; Plugin Manager &#187; Editor Button - Linkr&quot;. 
FAQ_4=How come related links do not show for all of my articles?
FAQ_4_ANSWER=To display related article links on all of your articles, go to &quot;Administrator &#187; Plugin Manager &#187; Content - Linkr&quot; and set &quot;Default related links&quot; to &quot;yes&quot;.
FAQ_5=How do I add keywords for related links?
FAQ_5_ANSWER=When related links are added automatically, Linkr will use the keywords in the article's metadata. You can edit the article's metadata keywords by going to &quot;Administrator &#187; Content &#187; Article Manager&quot; and selecting the desired article.
FAQ_6=How do I keep bookmarks or related article links from showing automatically on specific articles?
FAQ_6_ANSWER=To keep Linkr from automatically adding stuff to an article, add &quot;{linkr:none}&quot; (without the quotes) at the end of that article.
FAQ_7=I get a &quot;Unsuported Media Type&quot; message when I try to upload a file.
FAQ_7_ANSWER=To control what kind of files can be uploaded, see the settings in &quot;Administrator &#187; Site &#187; Global Configuration &#187; System &#187; Media Settings&quot;.
FAQ_8=What is the &quot;article slug&quot;
FAQ_8_ANSWER=It's a combination of the article ID and alias. You can choose to use it or not by changing the settings in &quot;Administrator &#187; Plugin Manager &#187; Content - Linkr &#187; Advanced Parameters&quot;. When SEF is turned off, article URLs using the slug will look something like &quot;index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=1:welcome-to-joomla&amp;catid=1:latest-news&quot;. On the other hand, when SEF is turned ON, article URLs which DO NOT use the slug might look something like &quot;index.php/more-about-joomla/1/9.html&quot;.
FAQ_9=How do I install a patch?
FAQ_9_ANSWER=Installing a patch is as easy as using the Joomla! installer to override the current files. Patches have version numbers and letters. Letters increase from A to Z, so a patch labeled &quot;E&quot; is more recent then a patch labeled &quot;B&quot;. Patches are good for the versions they indicate. So, a patch &quot;com.linkr.patch-231c&quot; is good for Linkr 2.3.1 as well as for a patched version &quot;Linkr 2.3.1b&quot;, but not for an older version &quot;Linkr 2.3.0&quot;.
