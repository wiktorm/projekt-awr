<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>The 'Attachments' extension for Joomla! allows files to be uploaded
and attached to articles or other types of content. 'Attachments' includes a
plugin to display the attachments and a component for uploading and managing
attachments. There are options to control who can see the attachments and
who can upload them, along with several other options to increase its
flexibility and usefulness. Note: all options are controlled through the
component manager. <strong>This extension only works for Joomla! 1.5.  It has
not been tested with version 1.6.</strong></p>
<p>The 'Attachments' extension has been translated into many different
languages.  Please see the <a class="reference internal" href="#translations">Translations</a> section for the list of
available translations.  Most of these languages packs are in the process
of being updated for 'Attachments' version 2.0.</p>

<div class="section" id="new-features-in-version-2-0">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">New features in Version 2.0</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">You can now &quot;attach&quot; URLs as well as files to content items.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You can now show the attachments list anywhere in an article (or content item).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">New optional field in attachments lists to display the name of the uploader</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Implemented a multi-installer so that installation of all parts of the
'Attachments' extension only requires one install (and enables the plugins
automatically).  This makes it extremely easy to install this extension
even though it now has one component and seven plugins.  Note that the
Joomla! 'upgrade' method is now the default for all parts of the
'Attachments' extension.  This means that you do not need to UN-install old
versions of 'Attachments' before installing this version.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Converted attachment file storage to use paths like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
attachments/article/23/file.txt
</pre>
<p>This eliminates all file prefixes used in earlier versions.  It does
mean that any one content item cannot have duplicate file names.  This
is not much of a limitation in practice.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Refactored the code to add &quot;Attachments plugins&quot;.  These plugins allow
attaching files to any content item that invokes the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">onPrepareContent</span></tt>
plugin.  For example, you can now attach files to Section and Category
descriptions.  With a bit of work, an extension developer can create a
new 'Attachments' plugin to support adding attachments to things like CB
personal info displays, Virtuemart product descriptions, etc.  See
section <a class="reference internal" href="#what-can-files-be-attached-to">What Can Files Be Attached To?</a> for more details.</p>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>In the administrative back end:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>It is now possible to add attachments to articles while they are
being created!</li>
<li>There is an option to suppress listing attachments to unpublished
or trashed articles or content items (although there is an easy
way to see them if you wish).</li>
<li>Added filtering to the list of articles</li>
<li>Reworked the tabular listing in the back end to allow sorting on
various columns</li>
<li>Several new administrative utility commands</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Improved Unicode handling in filenames</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="uploading-restrictions">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Uploading Restrictions</a></h1>
<p>Not all types of attachment files can be uploaded.  The 'Attachments' extension
will not allow uploading of files that are not permitted by the Joomla! Media Manager.
To see (or change) what file types are allowed, go to the <strong>Global Configuration</strong>
page and click on the <strong>System</strong> tab.  In the <em>Media Settings</em> area, there are
options for controlling what types of file extensions and mime types are permitted
for uploads. The 'Attachments' extension respects these limitations.  However, the
restriction on 'Legal Image Extensions (File Types)' is ignored.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attachments-settings">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Attachments Settings</a></h1>
<p>All of the settings for 'Attachments' are controlled via the
component manager. To access these settings, go to the administrative
back end and select &quot;Attachments&quot; under the &quot;Component&quot; menu.  Click
on the &quot;Parameters&quot; button on the right end of the tool bar and you will see
a series of parameters for this extension. These parameters include
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Who can see attachments:</strong> This setting controls
who will be able to see the links for the attachments. There are
three options:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>'<em>No one</em>' - If this option is selected, the attachments list and
links to download the attachments will NOT be visible to normal
visitors to the website (on the front end), whether they are logged
in or not.  In secure mode, this prevents downloading attachments
from the front end.  Administrators, however, will still see the
attachments list and be able to download the files even if 'no one'
is selected.</li>
<li>'<em>Any logged-in user</em>'. - If this option is selected, only
users who are logged into the website will be able to see the links
to the attachments.</li>
<li>'<em>Anyone</em>' - If this option is selected, the links to the
attachments will be visible to anyone visiting the website, whether
they are logged in or not.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Who can add attachments:</strong> This setting controls
who is able to add attachments to articles. There are four
options:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>'<em>No one</em>' - If this option is selected, the &quot;Add Attachments&quot; link
to upload the attachments will NOT be visible to normal visitors to
the website (on the front end), whether they are logged in or not.
In secure mode, this prevents uploading attachments from the front
end.  Administrators, however, will be able to see the &quot;Add
attachments&quot; link and be able to upload files even if 'no one' is
selected.</li>
<li>'<em>Article author only</em>' - The links to upload and edit attachments will only
be visible to the author of the parent article/content item (as well as
other users with higher permissions such as
editors/publishers/administrators).</li>
<li>'<em>Any logged-in user</em>' - The links to upload articles will be
visible to any user who is logged in.</li>
<li>'<em>Editor and above</em>' - The links to upload articles will only be
visible to users with Editor permissions and above.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Attachments published by default:</strong> This 'auto
publish' feature controls whether new attachments are published by
default when they are added. If 'Yes' is selected, when articles
are added, they will published immediately and will be visible to users. If
'No' is selected, new articles will not be published by default.
An administrator will need to publish them from the administrative back end
before the articles will be available.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Auto Publish Warning:</strong> If the auto-publish option is
disabled (see previous option), you may wish to inform those adding
attachments how they can get their attachment published. You can insert an
appropriate message here.  If this field is empty, a general system message
will be added suggesting that they contact their system administrator to
any newly uploaded attachments published.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Show titles:</strong> If set to 'Yes', a row of titles will be
added above the list of attachments describing what is in each column.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Show attachment description:</strong> This setting controls
whether the attachment description is shown in the list of attachments.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Show attachment uploader:</strong> Show the username of the
one who uploaded the attachment.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Show file size:</strong> This setting controls
whether the attachment file size is shown in the list of attachments.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Show number of downloads:</strong> This setting controls
whether the number of downloads is shown in the list of attachments.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">This option only works in secure mode!
In non-secure mode, files are maintained as static files and accessed
directly, without going through Joomla! code.  Therefore it is impossible
to update the number of downloads for a file when it is accessed this way.
So the display of the number of downloads will only work in secure mode
when this option is set to 'Yes'.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Show file modification date:</strong> If this setting
is 'Yes', the modification date for the file will be added to the
attachment list for articles that have attachments. If 'No' is
selected, no date will be added to the attachment list.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Format string for modification date:</strong> You may
select the format for the modification date by using the format
used by the PHP strftime() function.  Search the web with
'PHP strftime' for examples.  The default format (%x %H:%M)
gives dates with 24-hour time like 4/28/2008 14:21.  To
remove the time of day part, leave out the &quot;%H:%M&quot; part.  Note
that MS Windows and Linux PHP implementations may differ in
some of the codes that they support.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Attachments list order:</strong> This option allows you to specify the order in
which attachments will be listed in the attachments lists.  Most of the
options are self-explanatory:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>'<em>Filename</em>' - If this option is selected, the attachments will be
sorted alphabetically by the filename.</li>
<li>'<em>File size(smallest first)</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>File size(largest first)</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>Description</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>Display filename or URL</em>' - All attachments that have blank
display filenames will appear before the ones with display filenames and
will be sorted by their filenames.</li>
<li>'<em>Uploader</em>' - Sort by the name of the user who uploaded the attachment.</li>
<li>'<em>Creation date (oldest first)</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>Creation date (newest first)</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>Modification date (oldest first)</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>Modification date (newest first)</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>Attachment ID</em>' - If this option is selected, the
attachments will be sorted by the attachment ID.  This has the effect of
ordering the attachments in the order they were created.</li>
<li>'<em>User-defined field 1</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>User-defined field 2</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>User-defined field 3</em>'</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Name for user-defined field 1-3:</strong> If you have some
additional information about each attachment that you wish to add, the
'Attachments' extension allows you to defined up to three optional user-defined
fields.  To create a new field, insert the name for it in one of the three
entries.  Clear the name to disable the display and editing of this field.
The user-defined fields will be shown in the order listed here.  The maximum
length of each user-defined field name is 40 characters.  The data in these
fields may be up to 100 characters long.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Maximum filename length:</strong>
The maximum filename length for attachments list.  Filenames longer than
this will be truncated and put into the display filename (for display purposes
only, the actual filename will not be changed).  A value of 0 means the
filename length is unlimited by this option (the filename field in the attachments
database table is limited to 80 characters).   Note: If display filenames are truncated
by this option, the truncated filename will be inserted into the &quot;display filename&quot;
field.  This option only affects attachments added after this option is set.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Where should attachments be placed?</strong> This option controls
the location in the article (or content item) the list of attachments will be placed.
This option applies to all attachments lists:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>'<em>At the beginning</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>At the end</em>'</li>
<li>'<em>Custom placement</em>' - With this option, the attachments list will
appear in the article (or content item) where ever the special
tag: {attachments} occurs.  <strong>NOTE:</strong> For any article (or content
item) that does not include this tag, the attachments list will
appear at the end of the article (or content item).</li>
<li>'<em>Disabled (filter)</em>' - This option will disable the display of
attachments lists and suppress the display of any {attachments}
tags in articles or content items.</li>
<li>'<em>Disabled (no filter)</em>' - This option will disable the display of
attachments lists and will not suppress the display of any
{attachments} tags in articles (or content items).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>CSS style for attachments tables:</strong> To override the CSS
styling of attachments lists, specify your own style name here.  The default
style name is 'attachmentsList'.  See  the section <a class="reference internal" href="#css-styling-of-attachment-lists">CSS Styling of Attachment Lists</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>URL to register:</strong> If a special URL is needed to register new users,
insert that URL here.  This option might be useful if a special login page has been created.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>File link open mode:</strong>
This mode how the links to attachment files will be opened.  'In same window'
means the file will be opened in the same browser window.  'In new window'
means the file will be opened in a new window.  In some browsers, using the
'In new window' option will actually open the attachment in a new tab.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Subdirectory for uploads:</strong> The 'Attachments'
extension code will put files into this subdirectory under the top
of the Joomla site.  The default is 'attachments'.
Note that if this subdirectory is changed, it will only affect future
uploads.  Previously uploaded files will stay in the old subdirectory
and records in the attachments database will still point to those files.
If you wish to move the files from the old subdirectory to the new
subdirectory, you will need move the files and then update their
entries in the attachments database table manually.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Custom titles for attachments lists:</strong> By default, the 'Attachments'
extension inserts the title &quot;Attachments:&quot; above the list of attachments for
each article or content item (if it has attachments). In some cases, you may
prefer using some other term for specific articles or content items.  You may
specify the exact term you would like to use on an item-by-item basis. For
example, if you would like article 211 to use the custom title &quot;Downloads:&quot;,
then add this to this setting: '211 Downloads' (without the quotes). Use one
entry per line.  For other types of content items, use the form:
'category:23 This is the title for category 23' where 'category' can be
replaced by the name of the content item entity.  The example for articles
above could have been done with 'article:211 Downloads'.  Note that an entry
without a numeric ID at the beginning will be applied to all content items.
So it is good practice to put such global overrides first in the list and
then override the item-by-item custom titles afterwards.</p>
<p>Note: If you wish to change the titles used for attachments lists globally,
you may edit the translations file entry 'ATTACHMENTS TITLE' in the translation
files:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
administrator/language/qq-QQ/qq-QQ.plg_frontend_attachments.ini
</pre>
<p>where qq-QQ refers to the language designator code such as en-GB for English.
(If you are not familiar with Joomla! translation files, find the line that
has 'ATTACHMENTS TITLE' on left side of the '=' sign.  Edit anything to the
right of the '=' sign.  Do not change anything to the left of the '=' sign.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Hide Attachments for:</strong>
Comma-separated list of keywords or Sections/Categories of articles for
which the attachments list should be hidden. Five special keywords may be
used: 'frontpage' to suppress displays of attachments on the front page,
'blog' to suppress displays of attachments on any page using the 'blog'
layout, 'all_but_article_views' to allow displays of attachments only in
article views, 'always_show_section_attachments' to enable displaying
section attachments when 'all_but_article_views' is given, and
'always_show_category_attachments' to enable displaying category attachments
when 'all_but_article_views' is given. (Omit quotes when entering the
keyword options.)  <strong>The 'frontpage' option should be honored by all content
types, but content types other than articles, sections, and categories may
or may not honor the 'all_but_article_views' option and the other options.</strong>
Article Section/Category ids should be entered as numeric section and
category IDs separated with a slash(/): Section#/CategoryNum,
SectionNum/CategoryNum.  Specify just 'SectionNum' to cover all Categories
within the Section.  Example: 23/10, 23/11, 24</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Timeout for checking links:</strong>
Timeout for checking links (seconds).  Whenever a link is added as an
attachment, the link is checked directly (you can disable this check in the
form).  If the link can be accessed before the timeout, the file size and
other information about the link is retrieved.  If not, generic information
is used.  To disable the check, enter 0.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Superimpose URL link icons:</strong>
Superimpose URL link icons over the file attachment icon for each
attachment to indicate it is a URL.  Valid URLs are shown with arrows and
invalid URLs are shown with a red line across the file type icon (bottom
left to top right).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Suppress obsolete attachments (in back end):</strong>
Set the default for suppressing <em>obsolete</em> attachments in the administrative
back end.  In this context, <em>obsolete</em> attachments are ones attached to
unpublished or trashed parents. You can override this using the 'Show
attachments for' drop-down menu on the right just above the list of
attachments (on the same line as the filter).  When you use the drop-down
menu to control which attachments are visible, the system remembers that
setting until you log out as administrator.  So changing this parameter may
not seem to have an effect.  This parameter setting will come into effect
the next time you log in as administrator.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Secure attachment downloads:</strong> By default, the 'Attachments'
extension saves attachment files in a publicly accessible subdirectory.   If you choose
the <em>secure</em> option, the directory in which the attachments are saved will be made
publicly  inaccessible.  The download links for the attachments in the front end will
download the attachment files but will not be direct links.  This will prevent access
unless users have appropriate permissions.  If <em>secure</em> downloads are not selected,
the links to the attachments will be shown as the options above indicate, but the files
will still be accessible to anyone if they know the full URL, since the subdirectory is
public.  The <em>secure</em> option prevents access to users without appropriate
permissions even if they know the full URL, since this option prevents public access
to the attachments subdirectory.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>List attachments in secure mode:</strong>
List attachments in secure mode, even when users are not logged in unless
'Who can see attachments' is set to 'No one'.  The 'Who can see
attachments' option still controls whether attachments can be downloaded,
even in secure mode.  This option is only enforced in secure mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Download mode for secure downloads:</strong>
This option controls whether files should be downloaded as separate files or displayed
in the browser (if the browser can handle that type of file).  There are two options:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><em>'inline'</em> - In this mode, files that can be displayed by the browser will be</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">displayed in the browser (such as text files and images).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><em>'attachment'</em> - With the 'attachment' mode, files will always be downloaded</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">as separate files.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In either case, files that can't be displayed in the browser will be
downloaded as external files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="display-filename-or-url">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Display Filename or URL</a></h1>
<p>Normally, when files are uploaded (or URLs are installed) and listed in a list
of attachments, the full filename (or URL) is shown as a link to download the
attachment.  In some cases, the filename (or URL) may be too long for this to
work nicely.  In the upload form, there is another field called &quot;Display
Filename or URL&quot; in which the person uploading the file can insert an
alternative filename (or URL) or label to display instead of the full filename
(or URL).  For instance, some abbreviation of the filename could be added in
this field.  The field may be edited in the administrative back end when
attachments are edited.  Note: There is an option called &quot;Maximum Filename or
URL Length&quot; in the 'Attachments' extension options.  It can be set to automatically
truncate uploaded displayed filenames; the resulting truncated filename will
be inserted into the &quot;Display Filename or URL&quot; field.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attaching-urls">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Attaching URLs</a></h1>
<p>A new feature in 'Attachments' version 2.0 is the ability to &quot;attach&quot; URLs to
content items.  When you bring up one of the &quot;Add attachment&quot; dialog boxes,
you will see a button labeled as &quot;Enter URL instead&quot;.  If you click on it you
will get an entry field for the URL and see two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Verify URL existence?</strong> - In order to determine the file type of the</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">URL (to pick a suitable icon), the code queries the server for basic
information about the file including the file type and size.  In some
cases, the server will not respond to these requests even though the
URL is valid.  By default, Attachment will not accept URLs that have
not been validated by the server.  But if you know the URL is valid,
you can uncheck this option and force the 'Attachments' extension to
take the URL--but there are no guarantees the file type or file size
will be correct.  Note that the server will be queried whether or not
this option is selected.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Relative URL?</strong> - Normally you will enter URLs prefixed with 'http...' to</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">indicate an full website URL.  If you wish to point to files/commands
relative to your Joomla installation, use the 'relative' option.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The URLs are shown with the file-type icon and overlaid with an arrow
(indicating that it is a good link) or an red diagonal slash (indicating that
it could not be validated).  When you edit a URL, you can change whether the
link is valid or not to get the overlay you wish.  Also note that URL overlays
can be disabled entirely using the main <strong>Superimpose URL link icons</strong>
parameter.  There are several useful commands relating to URLs (and files) in
the &quot;Utilities&quot; command in the back end.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-can-files-be-attached-to">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">What Can Files Be Attached To?</a></h1>
<p>Besides attaching files or URLs to articles, it is now possible to
attach files or URLs to other types of content items such as Sections
and Categories (see below).  If appropriate 'Attachments' plugins are
installed, it may be possible to attach files or URLs to a wide variety
of content items such as user profiles, shopping cart product
descriptions, etc.  Basically any content item that is displayed on the
front end and uses the content event <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'onPrepareContent'</span></tt> can host
attachments (if a suitable 'Attachments' plugin is installed).  Content
items that invoke content events are typically items that have content
to be displayed (such as articles) or have descriptions that will be
displayed.</p>
<div class="section" id="attaching-files-or-urls-to-section-or-category-descriptions">
<h2>Attaching Files or URLs to Section or Category Descriptions</h2>
<p>With this version of attachments, users can attach files to Section and
Category descriptions.  These descriptions are generally only visible on
Section or Category Blog pages, if the basic parameter 'description' is set to
<em>Show</em> (via the Menu Editor).  Also note that it is not possible to attach
files or URLs to Section or Category descriptions in the Section or Category
editor.  They must be attached using the administrative back end
(&quot;Attachments&quot; under the &quot;Component&quot; menu item) or from the front end.</p>
<p>If you wish to learn more about how to develop a new Attachment plugin, there
is a manual that is available as part of this 'Attachments' installation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="plugin_manual/html/index.html">Attachments Plugin Creation Manual</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="css-styling-of-attachment-lists">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">CSS Styling of Attachment Lists</a></h1>
<p>The lists of attachments on the front end are done using a special
'div' that contains a table for the attachments. The table has
several different CSS classes associated with it to allow the website
developer the flexibility to customize the appearance of the table. Look in
the attachments plugin file CSS file (in plugins/content/attachments.css) for
examples. If you wish to change the style, consider copying the original
styles into the end of the same file and renaming 'attachmentsList' in the
copied section to something of your choice.  Edit the 'Attachments' parameter
(in the  component manager) and change the parameter <em>attachments table style</em>
to the new class name. Then modify the class definitions in your copied section
appropriately. This approach will allow you to quickly revert to the original
style by changing the plugin parameter <em>attachments table style</em> back to
its default, 'attachmentsList'. This also has the advantage that the
section of modified styles can be copied to a file and easily brought back in
when the version of 'Attachments' is upgraded. This could also be done via a
CSS &#64;import command.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="file-type-icons">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">File Type Icons</a></h1>
<p>The 'Attachments' extension adds an icon in front of each attachment in the
list of attachments. If you wish to add a new icon type, follow these steps:
(1) Add an appropriate icon in the directory 'media/attachments/icons', if an
appropriate icon is not already there; (2) Edit the file
'components/com_attachments/file_types.php' and add an appropriate line to the
static array $attachments_icon_from_file_extension which maps a file extension to an icon
name (all in the media/attachments/icons directory). If this does not work,
you may need to add an appropriate line to the array $attachments_icon_from_mime_type. (3)
Don't forget to make copies of the icon file and the updated file_types.php to
some directory outside of the website directories before upgrading the version
of 'Attachments' in the future.</p>

<div class="section" id="warnings">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Warnings</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>If you have attachment files that are sensitive or private, use the
*Secure attachment downloads* option!</strong> If you do not use the
secure option, the attachment files are saved in a public subdirectory
and are accessible to anyone that knows the full URL.  The <em>secure</em> option
prevents access by anyone that does not have appropriate permissions (as determined
by the options above).  See the discussion of the <em>Secure attachment downloads</em>
option above for more detail.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Every time a file is uploaded, the existence of the upload subdirectory
is checked and it will be created if if it does not exist.  By default the
subdirectory for uploaded files is 'attachments' in the root directory of
your web site files.  The name of the subdirectory can be changed using the
'Subdirectory for uploads' option. If the
'Attachments' extension is unable to create the subdirectory
for uploads, you must create it yourself (and you may have problems uploading
files).  Make sure to give the subdirectory suitable permissions for uploading
files.  In the Unix/Linux world, that is probably something like 775.  Note
the process of creating the upload subdirectory may fail if the top level
directory of your website has permissions that prevent the web server (and PHP)
from creating subdirectories.   You may need to loosen the permissions
temporarily to allow the subdirectory to be created by uploading attachments.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If this extension does not permit you to upload specific types of files
(such as zip files), be aware that the extension respects the restrictions
placed by the Media Manager on types of files permitted to be uploaded. This
is to prevent uploading of potentially harmful types of files such as html or
php files. The administrator can update the Media Manager settings to add
specific file types by going to the &quot;Global Settings&quot; item under the &quot;Site&quot;
menu, selecting the &quot;System&quot; tab, and added the appropriate file extension and
Mime type to the lists under the &quot;Media Manager&quot; section.</p>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>If you cannot see the attachments in the front end, there are several possible reasons:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>The attachment is not published.  You can change this in Attachments
manager page in the back end.</li>
<li>The parent article or content item is not published.</li>
<li>The option 'Who can see attachments' is set to 'logged-in' and you are
not logged in. Or the option 'Who can see attachments' is set to 'no
one'. This can be changed via the Parameter editor in the component
manager.</li>
<li>The 'Content - Attachments' plugin is not enabled.  Use the plugin manager
to enable it.</li>
<li>In the 'Content - Attachments' (via the plugin manager), the access
level is not set to 'Public'.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you encounter limits on the sizes of files that you attempt to upload,
try adding the following lines to the .htaccess file in the root of
your Joomla! website:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
php_value upload_max_filesize 32M
php_value post_max_size 32M
</pre>
<p>where you may change the 32M (megabytes) value to whatever you wish as the maximum
upload file size.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">'Attachments' now supports &quot;attaching&quot; URLs to content items.  If your server
is Windows Vista and you encounter problems attaching URLs that involve
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">localhost</span></tt>, this is a known problem related to IPv4 and IPv6 conflicts.
To fix it, edit the file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
</pre>
<p>Comment out the line that has <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">::1</span></tt> on it.  Note that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hosts</span></tt> is a
hidden system file and you may need to modify your folder options to show
hidden files to see and edit it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When you attach a file to an article in the Article editor, there is no
feedback that the file was attached.  But it does work!  You will see the
attachments once the article is saved.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">'Attachments' now supports attaching files to articles while they are being
created in the Article editor.  There is one limitation to this.  New
attachments are in a state of &quot;limbo&quot; after the file is uploaded and before
the article is actually saved for the first time.  During this (hopefully
brief) limbo period, the new attachments are identified by user id only.  So
if more than one person is using the same user account and they create
articles at the same time and add attachments at the same time, there is no
guarantee that the attached files will end up with the correct article.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There is a help forum and a 'Frequently Asked Questions' forum for the
'Attachments' extension that is hosted on the joomlacode.org website.  If
you encounter a problem that is not covered in this help page, please

<div class="section" id="upgrading">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Upgrading</a></h1>
<p>Upgrading is much easier now.  Simply install the new version of 'Attachments'.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>[This step is optional but highly encouraged to make sure you have
a backup of the attachments database in case something goes wrong.]</em>
Use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php">phpMyAdmin</a>
(or other SQL editing tool) to save the contents
of the jos_attachments table (Use the 'Export' option with
'Complete' inserts for data (not 'Extended' inserts).  You should also
back up the uploaded attachments files (usually in the 'attachments'
directory )</li>
<li><strong>You do not need to uninstall the previous version of Attachments.</strong> This
has been tested with 1.3.4 (but not with earlier versions).</li>
<li>If you wish to retain any existing attachments, you do not need to do
anything.  Simply install the new version and it will update everything
appropriately.</li>
<li>If you do not wish to keep existing attachments, delete them all first (in
the administrative back end).</li>
<li>The multi-installer will install all necessary components and plugins and
enable all plugins.  If do not want any of the plugins enabled, install
first and then disable plugins as desired.</li>
